# OpenliteSpeed
## issues

``
Sorry, currently one click installation only supports Centos(6-8), Debian(7-10) and Ubuntu(14,16,18,20).
You can download the source code and build from it
``

To solve this problem use this command and replace the current file with this file :

``
sudo nano /www/server/panel/install/openlitespeed.sh
``

the file : [Click here](https://github.com/aashahin/aaPanel/blob/main/openlitespeed/openlitespeed.sh)

and install by this command  `` bash /www/server/panel/install/openlitespeed.sh install ``
